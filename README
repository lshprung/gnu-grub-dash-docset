Here is a script and a Makefile for generating GNU Grub-related docsets for Dash. The script is based on the dash-docset-generation-template

- GNU Grub: https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate docsets from the latest edition of the GNU Grub-related Manuals, 
simply execute `make` from the same directory as this README file.
The latest edition will be downloaded from www.gnu.org and packaged 
appropriately.

The possible `make` targets are:

- `grub` - GRUB2 Documentation [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/]

Additional `make` targets that have not been implemented are:

- `grub-dev`    - GRUB2 Developers Manual [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub-dev/]
- `grub-legacy` - GRUB Legacy Documentation [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/legacy/]
- `multiboot`   - Multiboot Specification [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/]
- `multiboot2`  - Multiboot2 Specification [https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/]

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl    - https://curl.se/
- make    - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- pup     - https://github.com/ericchiang/pup
